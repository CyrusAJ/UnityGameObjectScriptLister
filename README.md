# UnityGameObjectScriptLister
Just a simple Unity c# script that creates an editor window to list out all the scripts on a selected gameobject(including all the scripts in its children)
Made this to save time on trying to understand other peoples code/gameobject layout, manually going through each child and seeing if they had a custom script attached got tedious real quick.
Find it in Window > Custom Script Lister
